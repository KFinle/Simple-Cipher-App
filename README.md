# Simple Cipher App
Simple message encoding app written in Python

Written for my 1st-year Python class. 

This Cipher has two modes. In "Caesar" mode, the user will declare a numeric shift factor, 
which will translate all characters in the provided message by a constant amount. 
In PolyAlphabetic mode, the user provides a password which will be used to shift each character
in the provided message based on the ASCII value of it's corrosponding position as determined by the 
password. 

Very simple app, but it was my first attempt building a GUI application in Python.
